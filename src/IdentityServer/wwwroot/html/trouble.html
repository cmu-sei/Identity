<h4>Things <i>We</i> Can Change</h4>
<p class="text-left">
    It is possible that we failed to include your
    issuer's certificate in our bundle of accepted
    issuers.  Please send your certificate's issuer
    common name.
</p>
<p class="text-left">
    It is also possible that we do not support some
    older certificates with weaker cryptography.
    Usually, this just affects certificates that
    are signed with the sha1RSA algorithm.
</p>

<h4>Things <i>You</i> Can Change</h4>
<p class="text-left">
    Start with a fresh browser.  Browsers tend to vary
    in how they maintain the state of your certificates.
    An easy test is to close all your browser windows
    before opening one to try again.  You can try opening
    a private or incognito browser also, but if that doesn't
    work, you should still try the "close-all-first" approach.
</p>
<p class="text-left">
    Be sure to select the correct certificate when the browser
    prompts you.  Some access card, like USGov PIV cards,
    present two certificates, only one of which is valid
    for client authentication. (Usually the first one displayed
    in the list.)
</p>
<p class="text-left">
    It is possible your web proxy is mangling the
    TLS handshake and thus <i>not</i> providing
    your client certificate to the web server. If
    you can authenticate to other sites using your
    certificate, it is worth asking your admins if
    this site needs a bypass from your proxy.
</p>
<p class="text-left">
    If you are behind an enterprise web proxy, there is not
    much troubleshooting with which we can help. We'd most likely
    need a packet capture of your TLS handshake from <i>outside</i>
    your web proxy.  And that will probably just show us
    that your client certificate is not being included in
    the handshake.
